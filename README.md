# Performance Measurements in Git

Test tracking performance measurements in git-notes.

Example report for [master](https://kaihowl.github.io/git-perf/master.html).

## Warning
Experimental only.
Repeated additions of measurements (instead of bulk additions) will be costly:
Each time the entire previous measurements are copied and a single line is
appended.

# Limitations

Contrary to git itself, git-perf does not support decentralized collection of
performance measurements. Instead, git-perf assumes that there is a single,
central place for the collection of metrics. This should usually be your source
foundry, e.g., GitHub. As performance measurements become less relevant over
time, we allow metrics to be purged. As a delete in git still preserves the
history before that deletion event, we have to rewrite history. To make
rewriting of shared history safe, git-perf deliberately dropped some basic
ideas of decentralized version control and instead focuses on the collection of
metrics in a single central location.
