name: Pre-Release Slow Tests

# This workflow runs the slow bash tests with a higher iteration scale factor
# to catch intermittent issues before releases. It's more thorough than the
# weekly slow test loop and is designed to be run manually before releases.
#
# The scale factor multiplies the base iteration counts in the test scripts:
# - Scale factor 1 (default): Normal iteration counts
# - Scale factor 4 (pre-release): 4x iterations for thorough validation
