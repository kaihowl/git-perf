.SH DESCRIPTION
Remove all performance measurements for commits that have been committed at or before the specified time (inclusive boundary, uses <=).
.PP
By default, this command automatically prunes orphaned measurements after removal (measurements for commits that no longer exist or are unreachable). Use \-\-no\-prune to skip this automatic cleanup.
.PP
Note: Only published measurements (i.e., those that have been pushed to the remote repository) can be removed. Local unpublished measurements are not affected by this operation.
