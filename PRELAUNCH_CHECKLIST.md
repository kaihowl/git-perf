- [x] Release workflow automation
- [x] Versioning system
- [x] Changelog automation
- [x] Latest release published (v0.17.2)
- [x] Published to crates.io (via release-plz)

### Documentation
- [x] README with quick start
- [x] Comprehensive usage examples
- [x] Configuration documentation
- [x] Migration guide
- [x] Manpage generation
- [x] Live example report
- [x] Statistical methods comparison
- [x] License file (MIT)

### GitHub Actions Integration
- [x] Install action (`.github/actions/install/action.yml`)
- [x] Used in CI workflows
- [x] Supports both `latest` and `branch` installation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Gaps - High Priority

### 1. ~~Missing GitHub Action Publishing~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue**: The cleanup action is not published as a reusable GitHub Action
- Current state: Cleanup workflow exists at `.github/workflows/cleanup-measurements-and-reports.yml`
- Gap: Not available for other repositories to use directly
- Impact: Users cannot easily integrate cleanup into their own workflows

**Action Required**:
- [x] Publish cleanup action as a composite action or workflow template
- [ ] Add to GitHub Actions Marketplace (optional but recommended)
- [x] Document how to use the cleanup action in other repositories

**Completed**: Created `.github/actions/cleanup/action.yml` as a reusable composite action with full documentation in `.github/actions/cleanup/README.md`. The existing workflow now uses this action.

### 2. ~~Missing Integration Tutorial~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue**: No end-to-end tutorial for integrating git-perf into a new GitHub project

**Action Required**:
- [x] Create `docs/INTEGRATION_TUTORIAL.md` with:
  - [x] Step-by-step setup guide for a new GitHub repository
  - [x] How to configure GitHub Actions for measurement tracking
  - [x] How to set up automatic reporting
  - [x] How to configure the cleanup action
  - [x] Example workflow files
  - [x] Troubleshooting common issues
  - [x] Best practices for measurement granularity

**Completed**: Created comprehensive integration tutorial at `docs/INTEGRATION_TUTORIAL.md` with all required sections including prerequisites, installation, measurement setup, GitHub Actions integration, reporting with the report action, cleanup configuration, audit/regression detection, advanced features (multi-environment tracking, statistical methods), troubleshooting, best practices, and a complete real-world workflow example.

## üìã Additional Recommendations

### Repository Metadata
- [x] Add repository description (currently empty)
  - Suggested: "Performance measurement tracking for Git repositories using git-notes. Track, analyze, and visualize metrics with automated regression detection."
- [ ] Add repository topics/tags for discoverability:
  - Suggested: `git`, `performance`, `metrics`, `benchmarking`, `rust`, `github-actions`, `continuous-integration`, `regression-testing`
- [ ] Set homepage URL (could point to example report or docs)

### Community & Contribution
- [x] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
  - Development setup instructions
  - Code style guidelines
  - PR submission process
  - Testing requirements
  - Conventional commit requirements
- [x] Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (if planning community contributions)
- [ ] Add issue templates for:
  - Bug reports
  - Feature requests
  - Documentation improvements
- [ ] Add PR template

### Documentation Enhancements
- [x] Add installation instructions beyond quick start:
  - [x] Installation from crates.io (already published)
  - [x] Add `cargo install git-perf` to README
  - [x] Building from source
  - [x] Pre-built binaries from releases
- [ ] Add FAQ section to README
- [ ] Create evaluation README in `evaluation/` directory (referenced in INDEX.md but missing)
- [ ] Add security policy (SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting
- [ ] Add examples directory with real-world use cases

### Publishing & Distribution
- [x] Published to crates.io (via release-plz automation)
- [ ] Create announcement blog post or documentation
- [ ] Prepare social media announcement content

### GitHub Actions Marketplace
- [ ] Create branding for GitHub Actions:
  - Icon and color for marketplace listing
  - Clear action description
  - Usage examples
- [ ] Publish install action to marketplace
- [ ] Publish cleanup action to marketplace

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test installation on fresh systems
- [ ] Validate all documentation links
- [ ] Test integration tutorial on a fresh repository
- [ ] Verify example report is accessible and current

### Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Review license compatibility with dependencies
- [ ] Add copyright headers if desired
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in git history

## üéØ Minimal Launch Requirements

To announce the project publicly, at minimum complete:

1. **‚úÖ CRITICAL** (Must have before announcement):
   - [x] Working release with binaries
   - [x] Basic documentation (README)
   - [x] Integration tutorial
   - [x] License
   - [x] Repository description

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY** (Should have for good first impression):
   - [x] Published cleanup GitHub Action
   - [x] CONTRIBUTING.md
   - [ ] Repository topics/tags
   - [ ] FAQ section

3. **üìå NICE TO HAVE** (Can be added post-launch):
   - [x] crates.io publishing
   - [x] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   - [ ] Issue/PR templates
   - [ ] GitHub Actions Marketplace listing

## üìù Notes

- The project is already functional and being used (as evidenced by the live example report)
- The main gaps are around making it easier for others to adopt and integrate
- The cleanup workflow exists but needs to be packaged for reuse by other projects
- Documentation is good but lacks the "getting started" narrative for new adopters

## Next Steps

1. ~~Create the integration tutorial as the highest priority item~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
2. ~~Package and publish the cleanup action for reuse~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. ~~Add CONTRIBUTING.md based on existing CLAUDE.md guidelines~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
4. Add repository metadata (description, topics)
