- [x] Core measurement tracking using git-notes
- [x] Statistical analysis (stddev & MAD)
- [x] Audit system for regression detection
- [x] Migration scripts (v1‚Üív2, v2‚Üív3)
- [x] Configuration system (.gitperfconfig)
- [x] Push/pull support for centralized metrics

### Testing & Quality

- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Mutation testing
- [x] Compatibility testing
- [x] Code formatting (rustfmt)
- [x] Linting (clippy)
- [x] Documentation validation

### Release Infrastructure

- [x] Multi-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS x86_64/ARM64)
- [x] Release workflow automation
- [x] Versioning system
- [x] Changelog automation
- [x] Latest release published (v0.17.2)

### Documentation
- [x] README with quick start
- [x] Comprehensive usage examples
- [x] Configuration documentation
- [x] Migration guide
- [x] Manpage generation
- [x] Live example report
- [x] Statistical methods comparison
- [x] License file (MIT)

### GitHub Actions Integration
- [x] Install action (`.github/actions/install/action.yml`)
- [x] Used in CI workflows
- [x] Supports both `latest` and `branch` installation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Gaps - High Priority

### 1. Missing GitHub Action Publishing
**Issue**: The cleanup action is not published as a reusable GitHub Action
- Current state: Cleanup workflow exists at `.github/workflows/cleanup-measurements-and-reports.yml`
- Gap: Not available for other repositories to use directly
- Impact: Users cannot easily integrate cleanup into their own workflows

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Publish cleanup action as a composite action or workflow template
- [ ] Add to GitHub Actions Marketplace (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Document how to use the cleanup action in other repositories

### 2. Missing Integration Tutorial
**Issue**: No end-to-end tutorial for integrating git-perf into a new GitHub project

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Create `docs/INTEGRATION_TUTORIAL.md` with:
  - [ ] Step-by-step setup guide for a new GitHub repository
  - [ ] How to configure GitHub Actions for measurement tracking
  - [ ] How to set up automatic reporting
  - [ ] How to configure the cleanup action
  - [ ] Example workflow files
  - [ ] Troubleshooting common issues
  - [ ] Best practices for measurement granularity

**Suggested Tutorial Structure**:
```markdown
# Integration Tutorial: Adding git-perf to Your Project

## Prerequisites
## Step 1: Install git-perf Locally
## Step 2: Add Initial Measurements
## Step 3: Configure GitHub Actions
## Step 4: Set Up Automatic Reporting
## Step 5: Configure Measurement Cleanup
## Step 6: Create Performance Dashboard
## Advanced: Custom Configuration
## Troubleshooting
```

## üìã Additional Recommendations

### Repository Metadata
- [ ] Add repository description (currently empty)
  - Suggested: "Performance measurement tracking for Git repositories using git-notes. Track, analyze, and visualize metrics with automated regression detection."
- [ ] Add repository topics/tags for discoverability:
  - Suggested: `git`, `performance`, `metrics`, `benchmarking`, `rust`, `github-actions`, `continuous-integration`, `regression-testing`
- [ ] Set homepage URL (could point to example report or docs)

### Community & Contribution
- [ ] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
  - Development setup instructions
  - Code style guidelines
  - PR submission process
  - Testing requirements
  - Conventional commit requirements
- [ ] Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (if planning community contributions)
- [ ] Add issue templates for:
  - Bug reports
  - Feature requests
  - Documentation improvements
- [ ] Add PR template

### Documentation Enhancements
- [ ] Add installation instructions beyond quick start:
  - Installation from crates.io (if published)
  - Building from source
  - Platform-specific notes
- [ ] Add FAQ section to README
- [ ] Create evaluation README in `evaluation/` directory (referenced in INDEX.md but missing)
- [ ] Add security policy (SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting
- [ ] Add examples directory with real-world use cases

### Publishing & Distribution
- [ ] Publish to crates.io (Rust package registry)
  - Update README with `cargo install git-perf` instructions
  - Ensure package metadata is complete
- [ ] Create announcement blog post or documentation
- [ ] Prepare social media announcement content

### GitHub Actions Marketplace
- [ ] Create branding for GitHub Actions:
  - Icon and color for marketplace listing
  - Clear action description
  - Usage examples
- [ ] Publish install action to marketplace
- [ ] Publish cleanup action to marketplace

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test installation on fresh systems
- [ ] Validate all documentation links
- [ ] Test integration tutorial on a fresh repository
- [ ] Verify example report is accessible and current

### Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Review license compatibility with dependencies
- [ ] Add copyright headers if desired
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in git history

## üéØ Minimal Launch Requirements

To announce the project publicly, at minimum complete:

1. **‚úÖ CRITICAL** (Must have before announcement):
   - [x] Working release with binaries
   - [x] Basic documentation (README)
   - [ ] Integration tutorial
   - [x] License
   - [ ] Repository description

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY** (Should have for good first impression):
   - [ ] Published cleanup GitHub Action
   - [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
   - [ ] Repository topics/tags
   - [ ] FAQ section

3. **üìå NICE TO HAVE** (Can be added post-launch):
   - [ ] crates.io publishing
   - [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   - [ ] Issue/PR templates
   - [ ] GitHub Actions Marketplace listing

## üìù Notes

- The project is already functional and being used (as evidenced by the live example report)
- The main gaps are around making it easier for others to adopt and integrate
- The cleanup workflow exists but needs to be packaged for reuse by other projects
- Documentation is good but lacks the "getting started" narrative for new adopters

## Next Steps

1. Create the integration tutorial as the highest priority item
2. Package and publish the cleanup action for reuse
3. Add repository metadata (description, topics)
4. Add CONTRIBUTING.md based on existing CLAUDE.md guidelines
5. Consider publishing to crates.io for wider Rust ecosystem adoption
