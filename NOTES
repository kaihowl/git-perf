No performance benefit of libgit2 other than a 4 ms forking overhead for calling the git binary.
Due to the small number of measurements, no generators/complicated iterators are necessary.
Since we have to rehash the blob for each new measurement, adding new measurements will become prohibitively expensive at some point. That is fine as we only expect to store a small number of measurements in here per commit.
