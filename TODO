- replace git-perf on master with rust version
- add github actions to repo, start with install, extend with full reporting
- report / command to get config info including the branch name?
- version get from git?
- make report work on aggregated results
- take std variance per epoch to allow catching staggered performance regressions?
- use stream / iterator for measurements (see cb261dfb for a start)
  - first define maximum size for measurements and measure if there is any improvement
- allow units in measurements?
- allow rerunning / replacing existing measurements in bulk groups. E.g., with a staging area.
- flag huge stddev? / show stddev in results?
