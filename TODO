- sigma==0 test?
- git bisect support / testing
- better error message for missing measurements (e.g., warn for pull)
- quoted args for kv?
- test case for git perf measure and command with args itself
- add value unit?
- move report logic to github action
- add minimum number of measurements
  - bootstrapping with just two values is risky and can make it hard to get more values accepted
