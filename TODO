- drop usage of libgit2 altogether!
- use `context` instead of handrolled error types?
- allow using different git / root folder than pwd
- create migration script and use different git notes branch for v2
- use stream / iterator for measurements (see cb261dfb for a start)
- take std variance per epoch to allow catching staggered performance regressions?
