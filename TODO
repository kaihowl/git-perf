- take std variance per epoch to allow catching staggered performance regressions?
- use stream / iterator for measurements (see cb261dfb for a start)
  - first define maximum size for measurements and measure if there is any improvement
- allow units in measurements?
- allow rerunning / replacing existing measurements in bulk groups. E.g., with a staging area.
- flag huge stddev? / show stddev in results?
