- pretty git-log for notes
  - no foxtrott merge
  - clean commit messages, e.g., which job etc added these perf measurements
- rename measurements (see rename.txt)
- measurement hierarchy
- multiple measurements audited, all failing printed
- allow for one-sided tests (only faster or only slower measurements trigger audit)
- sigma==0 test?
- git bisect support / testing
- better error message for missing measurements (e.g., warn for pull)
- quoted args for kv?
- test case for git perf measure and command with args itself
- add value unit?
- move report logic to github action
- change point analysis in report
- git perf good should offer --amend and pop into the edit (behave like commit)
  - rename to git perf accept instead?
- head_mean is confusing as this is the mean of the single min value by default
