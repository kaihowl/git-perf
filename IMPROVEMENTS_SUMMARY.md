# Manpage Generation Improvements Summary

## Problem Solved

The git-perf project had an automated manpage generation check in CI that was difficult to get right locally. Developers would often face CI failures like the one in [PR #264](https://github.com/kaihowl/git-perf/pull/264) because the locally generated manpage didn't match CI expectations.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Version inconsistency**: CI temporarily sets version to `0.0.0` to avoid version-based diffs, but local generation used the actual version
2. **Formatting differences**: Different pandoc environments could produce slightly different markdown formatting
3. **Complex manual process**: The manual generation process was error-prone and time-consuming
4. **No local validation**: Developers had no way to verify their manpage would pass CI before pushing

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Automated Generation Script (`scripts/generate-manpage.sh`)

- Replicates the exact CI process locally
- Temporarily sets version to `0.0.0` to match CI behavior
- Generates `docs/manpage.md` using the same pandoc command as CI
- Provides clear feedback and error handling
- Automatically restores original version after generation

### 2. Validation Script (`scripts/validate-manpage.sh`)

- Validates that `docs/manpage.md` matches CI expectations
- Shows exact differences if validation fails
- Provides clear instructions for fixing issues
- Can be run before pushing to catch problems early

### 3. Makefile Integration

- `make generate-manpage` - Generate manpage to match CI
- `make validate-manpage` - Validate manpage against CI expectations
- `make test-manpage` - Test both generation and validation
- `make check` - Run all checks including manpage validation
- `make help` - Show all available targets

### 4. Pre-commit Hook (`scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh`)

- Optional pre-commit hook for automatic validation
- Only runs when `docs/manpage.md` is being modified
- Prevents commits with manpage issues

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

- Updated `README.md` with quick commands and usage examples
- Created `docs/MANPAGE_GENERATION.md` with detailed guide
- Explains the problem, solution, and best practices
- Includes troubleshooting section

## Key Features

### Consistency with CI
- Uses the exact same process as CI (version 0.0.0, same pandoc command)
- Eliminates formatting differences between local and CI environments
- Ensures 100% compatibility with CI expectations

### Developer Experience
- Simple commands: `make generate-manpage` and `make validate-manpage`
- Clear error messages with actionable instructions
- Automatic dependency checking (pandoc, cargo)
- Comprehensive help and documentation

### Error Prevention
- Pre-commit hook prevents commits with manpage issues
- Validation script catches problems before CI
- Clear instructions for fixing common issues

## Usage Examples

### Before Making Changes
```bash
make validate-manpage  # Check current state
```

### After Adding CLI Options
```bash
make generate-manpage  # Update manpage
make validate-manpage  # Verify it's correct
git add docs/manpage.md
git commit -m "docs: update manpage for new CLI options"
```

### Troubleshooting CI Failures
```bash
make generate-manpage  # Generate correct manpage
git diff docs/manpage.md  # See what changed
git add docs/manpage.md
git commit -m "fix: update manpage to match CI expectations"
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `scripts/generate-manpage.sh` - Automated generation script
- `scripts/validate-manpage.sh` - Validation script
- `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` - Pre-commit hook
- `Makefile` - Make targets for easy access
- `docs/MANPAGE_GENERATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
- `README.md` - Updated with new commands and usage examples

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates CI failures**: Developers can now generate manpages that exactly match CI expectations
2. **Saves time**: Automated process is much faster than manual generation
3. **Reduces errors**: Validation catches issues before they reach CI
4. **Improves developer experience**: Simple commands and clear documentation
5. **Prevents regressions**: Pre-commit hook catches issues early
6. **Maintains consistency**: Same process used locally and in CI

## Testing

All scripts have been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Generation script produces manpage that matches CI expectations
- ✅ Validation script correctly identifies differences
- ✅ Makefile targets work as expected
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

## Future Maintenance

The solution is designed to be low-maintenance:
- Scripts automatically handle version changes
- No manual updates needed when CLI changes
- Clear documentation for new contributors
- Standard tools (make, bash) that are widely available

This solution completely addresses the original problem of difficult manpage generation and CI failures, providing a robust, automated, and developer-friendly system for maintaining manpage consistency.
